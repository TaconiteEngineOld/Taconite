# Taconite

### WARNING: Branch is dying

A Rust based game engine. This game engine is designed to be a new experience that won't leave you struggling through getting the engine to do what you want.

Active development is done in the OpenGL branch! Please be warned that not much will be happening inside of the SDL (`main`) branch.

## Current technology

* ECS system, soon to be completely custom.
* SDL2 (Currently switching to wgpu, see [wgpu branch](https://github.com/TeaSpillStudios/taconite/tree/wgpu)).
