# Taconite

A Rust based game engine. This game engine is designed to be a new experience that won't leave you struggling through getting the engine to do what you want.

Welcome to the OpenGL branch. This branch is currently not available for proper usage. This branch is a developmental branch that is being actively worked on and a notice will be posted here when it is ready.

## Current technology

* ECS system, soon to be completely custom.
* SDL2 (Currently switch to OpenGL, see [OpenGL branch](https://github.com/TeaSpillStudios/taconite/tree/opengl)).
